# Style Presets — 2D Cel-Shaded / Chinese-Animation Webtoon

This file is the **single source of truth** for the visual style of this Skill. The visual style is **locked** to 2D cel-shading + Chinese-animation webtoon language. Within that family, the user picks one of three sub-modes in STEP 0.

Its authority is limited to visual style: the main Skill's narration-handoff boundary, contract approval, scoped rework authorization, and stop conditions take precedence. Style checks do not authorize rerendering a batch, replacing approved cards, or continuing into final assembly/export. Preserve unaffected approved outputs.

If a shot or asset would need a non-2D look, stop and surface the conflict to the user — do not silently drift.

## Locked Family (do not break)

- **Always 2D** — hand-drawn / cel / webtoon language. No 3D rendering, no photoreal, no live-action.
- **Always flat / cel-shaded fills** — flat color + cel highlights, not gradient-heavy "cinematic" shading.
- **Always stylized characters** — not photo-anatomy; faces are simplified.
- **Always clean line art** — bold black or dark outline, no sketch-only no-outline look.
- **Always panel-aware composition** — frames should feel like a webtoon / manhua panel, even in motion.
- **Never bake unwanted text, watermark, or background music** into the rendered shot.

## Sub-Mode 1: 国漫 webtoon 流 (default)

**Closest references**: 国漫条漫 / 漫剧分镜感（《恶毒女配觉醒记》《魔尊要抱抱》《王爷别过来》类国漫短剧）
**Default for**: 都市悬疑 / 古风穿越 / 逆袭 / 都市情感 / 末世 / 惊悚

### Visual DNA
- Clean **bold black** outlines, slightly thicker on foreground characters
- **Flat color fills** with 1–2 cel highlights (no gradient airbrushing)
- **Strong light/shadow contrast** (hard cel shadows, not soft)
- **Webtoon panel composition** — vertical-scroll-friendly framing, often 9:16
- Backgrounds have **simplified painterly fills** with one or two focal accents, no full photoreal scenery
- Emotion conveyed through **sweat drops, motion lines, impact frames, sparkle effects** (webtoon vocabulary)
- Color logic: dramatic; one warm / cool dominance per scene

### Prompt Block (paste into every image/video prompt)

```
2D cel-shaded animation, Chinese-animation webtoon style, clean bold black outlines, flat color fills with cel highlights, dynamic panel composition, dramatic light/shadow contrast, vertical-scroll-friendly framing, expressive webtoon-style emotion cues (sweat drops, motion lines, impact frames), no 3D, no photoreal, no live-action, no watermark, no baked-in text
```

### Per-Shot Sub-Block Examples

## Sub-Mode 2: 日漫赛璐珞流

**Closest references**: 《鬼灭之刃》《咒术回战》《葬送的芙莉莲》类日式 TV 动画

### Visual DNA
- **Clean dark line art**, slightly thinner than 国漫 webtoon 流
- **Flat fills with subtle gradients** in some panels (more painterly than 国漫)
- **Softer cinematic lighting** — less hard cel shadow, more atmospheric
- Anime proportions: **larger eyes, smaller face ratio**, sharp jaw / soft features depending on character
- Camera work: more **classical anime shot grammar** (speed lines, dramatic angles, rim light)
- Emotion: more **subtle facial micro-expressions**; sweat drops and impact frames are still used but less heavy

### Prompt Block (paste into every image/video prompt)

```
2D cel-shaded anime, Japanese TV-anime cel style, soft cinematic lighting, clean dark line art, anime proportions, flat fills with subtle gradients, expressive anime micro-expressions, no 3D, no photoreal, no live-action, no watermark, no baked-in text
```

### Per-Shot Sub-Block Examples

- **Mid-shot dialogue**:
  > `[shot content]`, 2D cel-shaded anime, Japanese TV-anime cel style, soft cinematic lighting, clean dark line art, anime proportions, flat fills with subtle gradients, no 3D, no photoreal, no live-action, no watermark, no baked-in text
- **Action shot**:

## Style Drift Watch List (stop and surface, do not silently fix)

If a shot appears to show the following, record shot/version/time evidence and mark it failed or unverified as appropriate before using it as a dependent reference. Report a scoped proposal rather than automatically repairing that shot or the batch. Existing usable assets may still be handed off with clear findings.

- ❌ **3D / CGI look** — volumetric lighting, ray-traced reflections, Pixar-like rendering
- ❌ **Photoreal / live-action** — skin pores, lens flares, real-world photographic texture
- ❌ **Watercolor / gouache / oil-painting drift** — visible brush texture, no clean line art
- ❌ **Ink-wash / 水墨 drift** — sumi-e brush effects, no clean cel fill
- ❌ **No-outline drift** — soft / airbrushed look with no visible line art (acceptable for *backgrounds only*, not for characters)
- ❌ **Half-style drift** — some elements 2D, some 3D in the same frame (mixing 2D character with 3D prop / background)
- ❌ **Watermark / text baked in** — accidental logos, platform watermarks, generation tool text
- ❌ **Cross-sub-mode drift** — 国漫 webtoon 流 in one shot, 日漫赛璐珞 流 in the next (unless the user explicitly asked for style change between scenes)

When actual style drift is confirmed, first inspect the approved style block and propose the smallest evidence-backed correction. Obtain approval for contract changes and explicit scope for any additional generation; strengthen style wording only when it addresses the observed defect. Do not automatically rerun, switch sub-mode, replace all assets, or continue beyond narration handoff. Stop under the main Skill's limits.

## Continuity Block (paste after the style block, before shot content)

To keep identity stable across shots, append a continuity block that names the locked character/scene:

```
[continuity anchors: protagonist wearing [exact wardrobe], hair in [exact style], face shape [exact description]; scene layout [exact layout description]; lighting direction [left/right/top/etc]; color palette [warm/cool/neutral]]
```

This block stays the same across every shot of a character/scene; only the **action / camera** change.

## Quick Style Comparison (for the user in STEP 0)
