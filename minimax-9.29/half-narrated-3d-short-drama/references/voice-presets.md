# Voice Presets — Narration Voice for 3D Manhua Half-Narrated Short Drama (v2.0)

This file is the **single source of truth** for narrator voice selection. The Skill surfaces the curated Douyin-narration-style preset list in STEP 0; the user picks one and that `voice_id` is locked for the entire episode (and ideally the entire series).

**The two top-priority presets are 抖音解说男声 and 抖音解说女生.** The Skill must highlight these two first in STEP 0 Question 5, and pick the right one based on the genre track chosen in STEP 0 Question 2.

The narration voice is **fully decoupled from visual style** — the same voice list works for 2D, 3D, live-action, or any other visual track. This file is intentionally aligned with the 2D skill's voice-presets.md for consistency across the user's skill matrix.

### Voice preset label localization (v2.0.3)

The `voice_id` column is **machine-readable** and stays English (the locked catalog narrator voice etc.). The `voice_preset_label` column is **user-visible** and uses the platform's localized display name based on `user_language`:

| `user_language` | voice_preset_label for the locked catalog narrator voice | voice_preset_label for the selected catalog narrator voice |
|---|---|---|
| `zh-CN` (default) | 抖音解说男声 | 抖音解说女生 |
| `en-US` | Douyin Narrator (Male) | Douyin Narrator (Female) |
| `ja-JP` | Douyin ナレーター (男性) | Douyin ナレーター (女性) |
| `ko-KR` | Douyin 내레이터 (남성) | Douyin 내레이터 (여성) |

Rule: always use the platform's localized name if available; otherwise fall back to the Chinese name (the canonical / original name). Never translate `voice_id`.

The full platform voice catalog is wider than this list — do not surface all of them by default.

## Top-2 Douyin narration presets (the two most-used)

| # | User-facing label | voice_id | 风格 | 适合题材 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **★ 1** | **抖音解说男声（推荐默认）** | the locked catalog narrator voice | 沉稳、清晰、解说感强；最像抖音热门剧情号男旁白 | 都市悬疑 / 逆袭 / 末世 / 惊悚 / 古风玄幻 / 异世界冒险 / 通用 |
| **★ 2** | **抖音解说女生（推荐默认）** | the selected catalog narrator voice | 偏新闻播报但作为女声版最贴"女解说"——清晰、稳重、距离感适中 | 都市情感 / 校园 / 治愈 / 女频逆袭 / 女频古风 |

**The Skill must default to one of these two.** If the user does not pick, the Skill picks the one that matches the genre track chosen in STEP 0 Q2 (see auto-recommend table below). Only if both are explicitly refused does the Skill fall back to the broader preset list.

## Genre-driven auto-recommend table (based on STEP 0 Q2)

When STEP 0 Question 2 (genre track) is answered, the Skill automatically highlights the matching voice in Question 5's option list (as the ★ default). The user can still pick any other option.

| Genre track (STEP 0 Q2) | Auto-recommended voice (★ in Q5) | voice_id | 备选 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 都市悬疑 | 抖音解说男声 | the locked catalog narrator voice | 沉稳高管 |
| 古风玄幻 | 抖音解说男声 | the locked catalog narrator voice | 温润男声 / 抖音解说女生 |
| 都市情感 | **抖音解说女生** | the selected catalog narrator voice | 温润男声 |
| 校园青春 | **抖音解说女生** | the selected catalog narrator voice | 青年大学生 |
| 逆袭成长 | 抖音解说男声 | the locked catalog narrator voice | 沉稳高管 |
| 末世求生 | 抖音解说男声 | the locked catalog narrator voice | 抖音解说女生 |
| 异世界冒险 | 抖音解说男声 | the locked catalog narrator voice | 沉稳高管 |
| 自定义 | 抖音解说男声（默认） | the locked catalog narrator voice | （让用户挑） |

**Rule of thumb**:
- **男频题材**（悬疑 / 权谋 / 战斗 / 惊悚 / 末世 / 异世界冒险）→ 推男声
- **女频题材**（情感 / 校园 / 治愈）→ 推女声
- **古风 / 通用** → 默认推男声，用户可切女声

## Full curated Douyin-style preset list (shown in STEP 0)

The full list shown in STEP 0 Question 5. The top-2 above are always shown first; the rest are sorted by likelihood of being needed.

| # | User-facing label | voice_id | 风格 | 推荐场景 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ★ 1 | **抖音解说男声** | the locked catalog narrator voice | 沉稳、清晰、解说感强 | 男频 / 通用默认 |
| ★ 2 | **抖音解说女生** | the selected catalog narrator voice | 偏新闻播报的女声，最贴女解说 | 女频 / 情感 / 校园 |
| 3 | 温润男声 | a selected catalog voice | 偏温和，克制 | 古风 / 虐恋 |
| 4 | 沉稳高管 | a selected catalog voice | 偏成熟、权威 | 权谋 / 商战 / 悬疑 |
| 5 | 抖音青年解说 | a selected catalog voice | 真诚青年，更口语化 | 校园口语向 |
| 6 | 青年大学生 | a selected catalog voice | 偏年轻，校园感 | 校园 / 轻喜剧 |
| 7 | 自定义 / 试听 | （用户从完整音色表试听后填写） | — | — |

> **Default per genre = the ★ row matching the genre track chosen in STEP 0 Q2.** If the user does not pick, the Skill uses that ★. Do not re-ask.

## Voice Lock Rules (apply to the entire episode / series)

1. **One voice per episode** — once STEP 0 locks `narrator_voice_id`, every narration clip for every shot must use the same `voice_id`. No mid-episode voice swap.
2. **Speed stays within ±10% of preset default** — if the user wants faster/slower, set a per-episode `narrator_speed` and apply it consistently. Do not vary per shot unless the user asks.
3. **Emotion is per-shot but bounded** — default `neutral`; can be re-tuned per shot at STEP 5.6 (e.g. `surprised` for reveals, `sad` for reveals-with-loss, `angry` for climaxes). Do not flip emotion back and forth on adjacent shots.
4. **Record the preset name in the final spec** — so the user can reuse it on the next episode without re-picking.
5. **Series lock** — if the user is making a series, the same `narrator_voice_id` should be used across every episode for narrator consistency. Surface this in STEP 0 of episode 2+.
6. **Gender-match lock [NEW for v2.0]** — `narrator_gender_match` must be `ok` per the auto-recommend table. Do not force a male voice onto a female-frequency / female-protagonist story.
7. **Narrator volume lock [NEW for v2.0.1]** — `narrator_volume` defaults to 1.8 (range 1.2-2.0). Do not default to 1.0 — that makes narration inaudible in noisy environments and breaks the half-narrated short drama's core function.

## Default TTS Call Snippet

Use this as a starting point for the locked voice. Adjust `text`, `speed`, and `emotion` per shot:

```python
synthesize_speech(
    text="<narration line for this shot>",
    output_file_path="<shot_NN_narration.mp3>",
    voice_id="<locked voice_id from STEP 0>",  # 抖音解说男声/女生/其他
    speed=1.0,  # from STEP 0; per-episode lock
    emotion="neutral",  # per-shot; most shots stay neutral
    volume=1.8,  # [NEW for v2.0.1] 旁白音量比默认大 80%，让"半解说"在嘈杂环境也能听清
    pitch=0,
)
```

For batch generation, use `batch speech synthesis` with one entry per shot's narration line. All entries share the locked `voice_id`, `speed`, and `volume`; only `text`, `output_file_path`, and optionally `emotion` change.

### Narrator volume — 旁白音量 (NEW for v2.0.1)

> **核心问题**: 半解说短剧的旁白承载 60% 的剧情信息（背景/时间跳转/内心），默认 `volume=1.0` 在抖音/红果嘈杂环境（地铁/通勤/外放）下会被对白和环境音压住。**旁白音量必须显著高于默认**，让"解说"功能在 80% 的真实播放场景中成立。

**默认音量**（hardcoded in the snippet above）:

| 元素 | volume | 占比 | 理由 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 旁白 | **1.8** | 180% | 承载 60% 剧情信息，必须在嘈杂环境听清 |
| 对白 | 1.0 | 100% | 默认音量（视频原声） |
| 环境音 / SFX | 0.3-0.5 | 30-50% | 不能盖过旁白和对白 |

**音量范围说明**：平台 `volume` 参数范围 `[0.0, 10.0]`，1.0 是"标准音量"。1.8 = 比默认大 80%，已经在不破音的安全区间（>2.0 容易出现削波失真）。

**用户可调**：如果用户觉得旁白太冲/不够冲，让他们在 CHECKPOINT 3 调 `narrator_volume`（范围 1.2-2.0）：
- 1.2 = 略大 20%（安静环境偏好）
- 1.5 = 大 50%（默认推荐）
- 1.8 = 大 80%（嘈杂环境偏好，**半解说短剧默认**）
- 2.0 = 大 100%（最大安全值，强嘈杂环境）

**反模式**：
- ❌ 旁白和对白都用 1.0 — 旁白被对白压住
- ❌ 旁白 > 2.0 — 容易破音
- ❌ 旁白 < 1.2 — 嘈杂环境听不清，半解说功能废
- ❌ 在 STEP 7 装配时把旁白压小到和对白同音量 — 这正是要避免的

## Local audio repair and delivery (v1.0.1)

Follow the Delivery and Local Repair Contract in `references/qc-checklist.md`. A visible character mouthing narrator text is a video-shot defect, not evidence the narrator audio needs replacing. Retain qualified audio and repair only the evidenced shot under scoped authorization. For an actual audio defect, replace only the affected segment with the locked voice, preserving source files and passing segments.

Timing follows the shared usable-drift tolerance; do not rerecord speech solely to eliminate small offsets or chase old 1s/2.5s thresholds. New recordings/auditions need exact output count, attempts, cost exposure, and explicit or precise existing repair allowance. Deliver narration separately; do not call a user-edited narration master mixed or checked.

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Switching voice_id mid-episode to "match a character arc" — the narrator is one stable voice; do not dramatize the narrator.
- ❌ Boosting speed above 1.2 to fit a long line into a short shot — extend the shot duration first, do not speed up speech.
- ❌ Mixing `male-qn-*` family with `Chinese (Mandarin)_*` family in the same episode.
- ❌ Skipping the preset list and defaulting to whatever the platform API defaults to — the platform default is `male-qn-qingse`, which is **not** a Douyin narration style. Always honor the STEP 0 lock.
- ❌ **Gender mismatch [NEW for v2.0]**: forcing a male voice on a story that strongly implies female narration (e.g. a female-protagonist first-person romance where 抖音解说男声 feels jarring) — use the genre-driven auto-recommend table. If the user explicitly wants the other gender, honor it but warn them.
- ❌ **Default narrator volume = 1.0 [NEW for v2.0.1]**: makes narration inaudible in noisy viewing environments. Always set `narrator_volume=1.8` (or 1.2-2.0 range per user preference) so the half-narrated function survives subway / commute / phone-speaker playback.

## Voice-rebind warning (mid-episode change)

If the user asks to change voice mid-episode or in a later episode:
- **Mid-episode change** → an audition is not full-episode rerecording permission. If the user explicitly requests a whole-episode voice replacement, list all affected narration/counts/costs and obtain scope approval before generation. Preserve source files and qualified video; rebind after review. Local defects do not trigger episode-wide replacement.
- **Next-episode change** → just update the per-episode `narrator_voice_id`. Past episodes are not affected.
- If the user is on episode 2+ of a series, **default to reusing the previous episode's `narrator_voice_id`** without re-asking.
