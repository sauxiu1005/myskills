# Visual State Ledger Template (3D Manhua Half-Narrated Short Drama · v2.0)

Use this ledger for the approved 3D-manhua Q4 sub-mode, not a blanket ban on legitimate rounded/painterly traits. No unintended pure-2D, photoreal/live-action, or cross-mode replacement. User-facing fields follow the user's current language.

Apply the Delivery and Local Repair Contract (v1.0.1) in `references/qc-checklist.md`. Record shot/asset version, checked interval, actual visual/audio evidence, expected style and speaker/window, pass/warning/fail/unverified/not-applicable, retained outputs, real dependency links, local proposed repair, approval source, and remaining attempts/budget. Example checkmarks are not prefilled results.

Only actual media evidence proves continuity or mouth-state compliance; ledger/prompt edits do not repair pixels. Inspect real tail-frame dependencies after a replacement but do not regenerate neighbors merely for sharing a character. Keep old versions; new candidates need review. Usable timing deviations follow the shared ≤1.5s OR ≤20% rule, not a demand to recreate an exact planned frame count.

## Per-shot ledger fields

- Shot ID
- Character pose and position
- Character expression
- Prop state and orientation
- Scene layout
- **3D Material block** ← NEW for 3D (skin / fabric / metal / glass texture and behavior)
- Lighting direction
- Time of day
- Background motion
- Emotional state
- **Style check** (one-line confirmation that the shot stays within the locked sub-mode)
- **First-frame anchor** (cross-reference to storyboard, kept short here)
  - `first_frame_source`: file path
  - `first_frame_anchor_role`: `character_main_card` / `character_3view_side` / `character_3view_back` / `scene_main_card` / `scene_aux_card` / `last_frame_of_shot_NN` / `reset_anchor`
  - `first_frame_angle_match_confirmed`: `true` / `false` (3D manhua hard requirement)
  - `reset_anchor`: `true` / `false`
- **Plot point ref** ← NEW for v2.0 (links to STEP 5.5 reconciliation table; P001, P002, ...)
- **`shot_audio_schedule` ref** (NEW for v2.0.2) ← links to the locked `shot_audio_schedule` for this shot (narration_window, dialogue_window)
- What must remain unchanged
- What must change in the next shot

## Continuity rules

- Write concrete visual facts, not moods.
- Each entry must be usable as the next shot's opening state.
- Keep identity anchors separate from transient motion.
- Mark any reusable prop or scene state explicitly.
- **Style consistency**: compare actual form/material/depth/composition to the selected sub-mode and anchors. Different wording or compatible lighting/expression is not proof of drift. Record the true defect and propose a local fix under authorization; do not relabel the ledger as passed or blindly strengthen the default style block.
- **First-frame anchor consistency**: the ledger's `first_frame_source` must match the storyboard's `first_frame_source` for the same shot. If they disagree, the storyboard wins.
- **First-frame angle consistency (3D manhua)**: the ledger's `first_frame_anchor_role` and `first_frame_angle_match_confirmed` must match the storyboard. A side camera move paired with a front card is a hard inconsistency.
- **3D material consistency (3D manhua)**: the material block must stay stable across shots of the same character/scene.
- **Plot point coverage (v2.0)**: every shot's ledger entry must reference at least one plot point from `script_reconciliation_table` (via `plot_point_refs`). If a shot has no plot point ref, the user gets a flag.
- **Last-frame archive**: after the shot is generated, write down the path to `clips/shot_NN_last.png` so the next-shot ledger entry can reference it.

## 3D Material block — what to record

For each character and scene, list the **3D material vocabulary** that must stay consistent:

### Character materials
- **Skin**: record only the approved mode: soft non-photoreal PBR (guoman), smooth stylized (rounded-manhua), or painterly surface retaining 3D form (painterly-manhua); these are alternatives, not a mixed universal requirement.
- **Hair**: matte cel-shading, individual strand detail, consistent color and length
- **Fabric (main wardrobe)**: cloth/silk/leather/metal, draping behavior, fold density, response to wind
- **Metal accessories**: earring / buckle / sword hilt — metallic reflection, color temperature
- **Eye color / iris detail**: stable across shots
- **Skin tone**: warm / cool / neutral, must match character card

### Scene materials
- **Architecture**: wood / stone / brick / glass / metal — all 3D, not 2D illustrated
- **Furniture**: material and color
- **Lighting equipment visible in scene**: lamp / window / candle / magic source
- **Atmospheric effects**: fog / dust / light rays / particles (3D-rendered, not painted)
